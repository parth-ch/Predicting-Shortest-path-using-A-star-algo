This project builds and analyzes a city route graph based on distance and travel price of bus using Python. It reads a CSV file containing route data of bus travel and constructs a graph where cities are nodes and routes are weighted edges. Visualization and A * algorithms are applied for route optimization to find the minimal path between two cities. The dataset is scraped from website using python.
